 Pak Inflation AI 
The Ultimate Economic Defense Console for Pakistan
 Project Overview
Pak Inflation Sovereign AI is a professional-grade financial analytics dashboard and economic advisor. Built during a period of significant economic transition, this tool empowers Pakistani citizens and policymakers to track, forecast, and simulate the impact of inflation on essential commodities.

Unlike standard trackers, this console uses Ensemble Machine Learning and is hard-coded with real February 26, 2026, price indices, including the official Rs. 258.17 petrol hike.
